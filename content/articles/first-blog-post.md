## Shipments

We're just waiting on things to ship to be able to test our electrical design along with our heated blade core. As shown in the blog photo, our design has a blade that has a heating element inside of it (behind thermal shielding). The element was ordered in late December and we're expecting to receive the part within the next two weeks. 

It's one of our most expensive parts coming in at $500. Fortunately, like everything in manufacturing, if we were to make more units, the cost per part would go down substantially. They offered us three for $250 each, but realistically, if one didn't work, the other two wouldn't be of much use...hoping the one comes soon though.

All the electrical components are expected to arrive in the coming week or two as well.

## Testing Stages
The goal is to test the circuitry and the heating element with the blade first. We want to ensure that

1. Our circuitry works as expected (power consumption is ~500 Watts)
2. The blade reaches expected temperature (~132 degrees Celsius)
3. Nothing catches on fire

Once these are satisfied, we can go on with ordering the rest of the mechanical parts to complete the base and attach the blade to the torsional spring. The drawings for all mechanical parts are complete and we're getting ready to send those into the shop shortly. The lead time on those parts shouldn't be an issue since in the meantime, we have lots of testing to do.

Testing everything together before march would be ideal. Not only do we want something working for the presentation, but we want to be confident that by mid-end of April (when we go into Trusscore, our industry partners to present), our prototype will be solid.

## Wrapping Up
That's it for now. Our hands are tied just waiting on shipments. We're trying to build in enough time in our testing schedule to order another heating element if need be. Those have a hefty 5 week lead time though, so we're pretty tight on time.

Fingers crossed nothing goes horribly wrong!
